# Inconvo Tech Test - Hamish Charles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem
To create an ordered list of Premier League Clubs that is able to be filtered and clicked into for detail. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C1rFtH5xxoaNx7ztY1VCA-HSfsUw6NKcbFMaxK2z9hE/edit?usp=sharing) for details.

## Solution
This solution has been created with React as my Vue.js is fairly rudimentary at the moment.

## What's missing (due to time constraints)
1. Cancel button not wired up yet (Clearing the text box does the same thing).
2. Styling for Team Card overlay (foreground mask).
3. Styling for Search box including margins, padding, background.
4. Testing - there are only a few at the moment.
5. Styling for teams details.
6. Refactor Team Card CSS out from the Team List CSS.
